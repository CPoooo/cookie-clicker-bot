# cookie-clicker-bot
Bot that plays cookie clicker using selenium and a chrome web driver to open chrome
and then run the experimental website for cookie clicker. (So I am not botting their official game but this webpage created for botting).

Searches through the site to find the element that is the cookie and then clicks on that element.
Every 5 seconds the bot checks through the available upgrades by using their html elements.
Converts the text that contains the price into an integer, and then using this new knowledge creates a dictionary of the prices for each upgrade.
After this it will then get the current cookie count and will decide to buy the most expensive upgrade (caveman AI logic, however this is not the WORST technique ever) that it can buy, and will buy it.
Will od this loop until your heart's desires are fulfilled and you have clicked ALLLL the cookies EVER
